# Return Window — Task Board

> Single source of truth for what's being worked on. Read at session start,
> updated immediately when any bug, follow-up, or feature comes up in conversation.
>
> **Entry format:** one-line summary · optional 1–2 lines of context · optional
> link to the session or BUILD.md milestone that spawned it.
>
> Rule: work items in Now only. Everything is measured against "does this get a
> real user on it today."
>
> **Done split:** TASKS.md Done = one line, plain English, no commit hash or backfill
> numbers. HISTORY.md = full detail (commit hash, root cause, what was verified). If
> BUILD.md's data model or invariants change, update BUILD.md in the same commit.
>
> **Scope control:** Claude Code works only on (a) items in 🔴 Now, or (b) the explicit
> task given in the current session — and in case (b), 🔴 Now must be updated to reflect
> it BEFORE work starts. Scope expansions mid-session ("while I was in there I also
> fixed X") must be added to Now or confirmed before proceeding — no silent scope creep.
> At session close, state explicitly: committed? pushed? deployed? "Tests passed" does
> not mean deployed. If any of those three didn't happen, say so plainly.

## 🔴 Now
- [ ] **Fix refunded-misclick problem** — confirm dialog on "Mark as refunded" (teaching
      copy), auto-archive on refunded transition (atomic write, same handler), backfill
      existing refunded orders, fix the one real H&M order (`66993117803`) accidentally
      refunded today (2026-07-03) back to returned. New rule from last session applies:
      not ✅ Done until owner hand-tests and confirms in production.
- [ ] **Bugs 2–5 from owner's manual-review triage** — separate sessions, not yet
      enumerated here. [needs clarification: full list]

## 🟡 Next
- [ ] **Verify in production: archived orders with upcoming deadlines don't get
      reminders** — pending real data (no order is currently both archived and has an
      active deadline). The returned/refunded half of this check is now confirmed
      against real data (MANGO #F4VLSF) — see HISTORY.md. Only the archived case is
      still open.
- [ ] **Reconsider Archived dropdown option in SearchFilterBar** now that there are two
      dedicated entry points (Sidebar nav + Settings link, added by Bug 1 fix) — likely
      remove for clarity, but verify after Bug 1 ships. Deliberately not done in the
      same commit as the Bug 1 fix (scope control).
- [ ] **Manual UX review of today's changes** — nothing shipped today was hand-tested
      in production. Open `app.myreturnwindow.com` and verify: (1) Archive/Unarchive
      button on an order, (2) "Archived" filter tab shows archived orders and hides
      them from All, (3) delete button shows the confirm dialog before acting, (4)
      "Mark as refunded" appears on a returned order and advances its status, (5)
      "Track your return →" link appears on any order where a return label was forwarded.
- [ ] **Clean up owner account test/dev data** so it reflects what a real first-time
      user would see. (Split out of the homepage item; do after homepage ships.)
- [ ] Get **one friend** logged in and using it end-to-end (the real milestone)
- [ ] Buy domains: `returnwindow.com` (+ `closetwindow.com`, `windowshopping.com`)
- [ ] Smoke-test the full flow on production after Mango fix: sign in → forward
      an order email → see it parsed → see the return window / deadline
- [ ] **Move retailer-prefix merge marker off `Order.userNote`** — today's
      backfill wrote `[auto] retailer prefix match: ...` into `userNote`, which
      per Milestone 10 is the user-authored review note. If `[auto]`-prefixed
      entries accumulate, user notes become indistinguishable from system notes
      in queries and the admin dashboard. Needs a proper field or audit log.
      Spawned by `2cb5de2`.

## 👀 Watching — parked, revisit only if it recurs
- [ ] **Post-beta: delivery-only orders (no `shipping_confirmation`)** — during alpha,
      4 orders (H&M, Freda Salvador, Tuckernuck, Shopbop) had only a delivery email,
      no shipping confirmation. Root cause: users forwarding manually and not forwarding
      every email. Once real Gmail-filter forwarding replaces manual forwarding, delivery-only
      orders should become rare. If still common post-beta, investigate the discard gate
      and extraction pipeline for dropped `shipping_confirmation` emails — don't assume
      "user didn't forward it" anymore.
- [ ] **Mango order-number mismatch** (`F4VLSF` vs `F4VLSF00`, ReBOUND suffix) —
      Do NOT fix yet. Watch whether third-party return services (ReBOUND, Narvar,
      Happy Returns, etc.) consistently append suffixes across multiple retailers.
      If the pattern recurs, build fuzzy suffix-strip matching in `lib/linkOrder.ts`.

## ⚪ Someday
- [ ] Closet Window (wardrobe intelligence) — only after Return Window has
      retention data
- [ ] Window Shopping (pre-purchase / price tracking) — same gate
- [ ] Holding-company structure ("Window") — not now
- [ ] **Rotate Postmark inbound webhook URL** — still points at
      `returns-assistant.vercel.app/api/inbound`. Deliberately deferred in
      Milestone 20 (both URLs serve the same app); worth rotating eventually
      for consistency once there's a low-risk window.
- [ ] **Extraction quality: retailer name specificity** — AI extracts different
      precision from different email types for the same retailer (Proenza vs
      Proenza Schouler from shipping vs order-confirmation templates). A
      prompt-level fix could reduce reliance on the retailer-prefix fallback.
      Surfaced by today's `2cb5de2`.

## ✅ Done
- [x] Bug 1+6: Archive/Unarchive UI made visible; deadline reminders now respect displayStatus.
- [x] Marketing homepage at myreturnwindow.com shipped with beta signup — public marketing page (host-routed, no auth), `/api/beta-signup` storing + deduping emails and notifying admin; magic-link login on app.myreturnwindow.com verified unaffected.
- [x] H&M "Your return package has arrived" re-forwarded after the classify-gate fix — landed correctly.
- [x] Documentation restructured — BUILD.md trimmed to current-state reference; HISTORY.md created with full chronological detail; TASKS.md Done section reformatted to one-liners.
- [x] Dashboard UI additions — "Track your return" link, "Mark as refunded" button, Archive/Unarchive button, and Archived filter tab added to dashboard and order detail page.
- [x] Soft-delete wired to dashboard delete buttons — both buttons now hit the soft-delete endpoint with a confirm gate; old hard-delete server action removed.
- [x] Refund check-in reminder added — fires 5 or 10 days after returnedAt depending on whether return tracking is present.
- [x] Archive + soft-delete fields added to Order — PATCH endpoints, activeOrderFilter helper, hard-delete cron step.
- [x] displayStatus logic fixed — delivery emails advance to "shipped"; return_label emails auto-advance to "return_requested".
- [x] Return-shipment tracking fields added — returnCarrier, returnTrackingNumber, returnTrackingUrl scraped from return_label emails.
- [x] Sunday weekly digest shipped.
- [x] Subject-line order number extraction fixed — shipping emails that state the order number only in the subject now link correctly.
- [x] User-facing displayStatus field shipped — badge, filter dropdown, manual advancement buttons, tracking link.
- [x] Magic-link login fixed in production — Auth.js v5 env var mismatch resolved.
- [x] Admin onboarding view added — lists all users' forwarding addresses, session-gated.
- [x] Custom inbound domain (mail.myreturnwindow.com) piloted and rolled out to all users.

## ⚠️ Known issues / tech debt
<!-- Claude Code: append issues you discover here, newest first, with the file involved -->
- Order-number normalization is brittle across retailers (Mango is the first
  case; expect more retailer-specific suffix quirks).
- Retailer-name prefix matching has a known collision risk: "American" (8 chars)
  is a prefix of "American Eagle", "American Vintage", etc. — two orders from
  different "American X" retailers with the same order number would be wrongly
  merged. Accepted trade-off; every such merge is flagged needsReview + logged
  in Order.userNote (`lib/linkOrder.ts`).

## 📝 Decisions log
<!-- One line per decision so future-you and Claude Code know WHY -->
- Brand family: **Return Window** (wedge) → **Closet Window** → **Window Shopping**,
  unified "Window" metaphor. Build/validate Return Window first; expansions wait
  for retention data.
- Auth: Auth.js v5 — use `AUTH_*` env vars only, never the legacy `NEXTAUTH_*`.
- Inbound email domain is now `mail.myreturnwindow.com` for all users (rolled
  out from a one-account pilot); old `+tag` `postmarkapp.com` addresses still
  resolve, so no user's existing forwarding rule broke.
- Extraction falls back to html-to-text when textBody is empty — required for
  iPhone/Apple Mail forwards, which are HTML-only.
- Forwarded-header orderDate fallback handles Apple Mail format + reads
  htmlBody for HTML-only iPhone forwards.
- Retailer-prefix fallback added to order linking — "Proenza" / "Proenza Schouler"
  was the first real case; MIN_RETAILER_PREFIX_LENGTH=4, exact order number
  required, every merge flagged needsReview + logged.
- Outbound mail consolidated onto myreturnwindow.com — reminders from
  `reminders@myreturnwindow.com`, logins from `hello@myreturnwindow.com`
  (LOGIN_FROM_EMAIL ?? REMINDER_FROM_EMAIL fallback in auth.ts).
